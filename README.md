## Project Overview

### Industrial Application: Table Saw
A table saw is an essential tool in woodworking, featuring a circular saw for cutting wood. It is commonly powered by an electric motor, providing the necessary force for various cutting tasks.

### Gearbox Selection: Constant Mesh Gearbox
In this project, a constant mesh gearbox is chosen. This type of gearbox features all gears constantly in mesh, with dog clutches used to engage and disengage the gears. The constant mesh gearbox offers reliability and efficiency, making it a suitable choice for the table saw application.

### Design Calculations
Design calculations were performed based on the principles and knowledge acquired in the design of machine elements. These calculations ensure the gearbox meets the required performance specifications and durability standards.


### 3D CAD Design
A complete 3D CAD model of the gearbox was created using Solid Edge. This detailed design provides a visual representation and aids in the manufacturing and assembly processes.
